                The Hour of Code started as a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify "code", to show that anybody can learn the basics, and to broaden participation in the field of computer science. It has since become a worldwide effort to celebrate computer science, starting with 1-hour coding activities but expanding to all sorts of community efforts. Howard County's version of Hour of Code is made by students, for students. We aim to provide aspiring computer scientists with an opportunity for skill development and friendly competition.
